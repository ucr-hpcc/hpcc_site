## Text Viewing

Here are a few commands that are used to just display the text within a file:

```bash
more <FILENAME>     # Views text, use space bar to browse, 'q' to quit
less <FILENAME>     # Also views text, uses arrow keys to browse, 'q' to quit
cat  <FILENAME>     # Concatenates files and prints content to screen
```

## Text Editors

* **Nano**
  * A simple terminal-based editor.
* **Neovim**
  * Non-graphical (terminal-based) editor. Neovim is an improved version of vim.
* **Vim** **Gvim**
  * Non-graphical (`vim`) or window-based editor (`gvim`). Vim is the improved version of vi.
* **Emacs**
  * Non-graphical or window-based editor.
* **Visual Studio Code**
    * Graphical editor that runs on your local machine that supports different plugins.

## Nano

The `nano` editor is the simplest to use and can be good for beginners:

```bash
nano <FILENAME>     # Open file if it exists, or create it
```

Navigation in `nano` uses the arrow keys, and all other commands are noted at the bottom of the screen.
The `CTRL` key is used in combination with other keys to execute commands in `nano`.

For example, at the bottom of the `nano` screen it is noted that `^X` is used to exit.
This means you will need to hold the `CTRL` key and then press `x` in order to quit.
After that, just follow the on screen prompts at the bottom.

For more `nano` commands, please visit [Overview of nano shortcuts](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html).

## Neovim / Vim / GVim / VI

All of these editors follow the same principals.

```bash
nvim <FILENAME>     # Open file if it exists, or create it
vim <FILENAME>      # Open file if it exists, or create it
gvim <FILENAME>     # Open file if it exists, or create it (must have XForwarding or VNC)
vi <FILENAME>       # Open file if it exists, or create it
```

For more information please visit [Vim Manual](/manuals/linux_basics/vim/).

## Emacs

Navigation in `emacs` also uses the arrow keys. It is similar to `nano`, in that, `CTRL` is combined with other keys to execute commands.

For example, to open a file, simply run the command with a file name:

```bash
emacs <FILENAME>     # Open file if it exists, or create it
```

Then, after you have made some changes, exit by holding the `CTRL` key and then pressing `c`, releasing and then holding the `CTRL` key once more and pressing `c` again.
After that, just follow the on screen prompts at the bottom.

For more commands in `emacs` please visit [GNU Emacs Reference Card](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards/pdf/refcard.pdf)

## Visual Studio Code

### Install

This editor should be installed on your local machine (ie. workstation, laptop).
Please visit [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for software download.

### Remote Editing

To setup Visual Studio Code to remotely edit files on the cluster, please refer to our guide to [VSCode Usage on HPCC](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals/hpc_cluster/selected_software/vscode/).

## RStudio Server

Two options exist to access the `RStudio Server` [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment):

  1. [Shared Web Instance](#1-shared-web-instance)
  2. [Compute Node Instance](#2-compute-node-instance)

While the `Shared Web Instance` is easier for less experienced users, it does not allow to load a specific R version nor access more extensive computing resources.
Thus, experienced users may prefer the `Compute Node Instance` as it does not share these limitations.

### 1. Shared Web Instance

R users can log in to their HPCC accounts via an RStudio Server instance.
To do so, visit the [HPCC RStudio Server](https://rstudio.hpcc.ucr.edu).
Next provide your HPCC login credentials and click the `Sign In` button.

### 2. Compute Node Instance

#### a. Interactive

Alternatively, an RStudio Server instances can be started directly on a compute node and accessed via an SSH tunnel.
This involves the following steps.
    
  1. SSH into the cluster as outlined [here](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals/linux_basics/intro/).
   
  2. Log in to a compute node interactively via `srun`, where the proper parameters need to be specified by the user.
  These include partition name, RAM, number of CPU cores, wall time limit, etc. Additional details on using `srun` are available 
  [here](https://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals/hpc_cluster/jobs/#submitting-jobs).
   
   ```bash
   srun --partition=short --mem=8gb --cpus-per-task=2 --ntasks=1 --time=2:00:00 --pty bash -l
   ```
   
  3. Load the latest versions of `R` and `RStudio Server` using the module system:

   ```bash
   module unload R
   module load R/4.2.2 # Or latest version (previously it was R/4.1.2)
   module load rstudio-server/2022.02.0-443 # Or latest version (previously it was rstudio-server/2021.09.1-372)
   ```

  4. Start RStudio Server:
   
   ```sh
   start-rserver.sh
   ```

  5. Next follow the instructions printed to the terminal after running `start-rserver.sh`. The command-lines given 
  in these instructions need be executed in a terminal of a user's local system, and not on the remote system where
  `start-rserver.sh` was exectuted.

#### b. Non-Interactive

The steps for launching an interactive job can be integrated into a script and submitted non-interactvely for a quicker deployment of a `RStudio Server` instance on a compute node.
Instructions outling how to do this are located [here](https://github.com/ucr-hpcc/hpcc_slurm_examples/blob/master/rstudio-server/README.md#non-interactive).

## Jupyter Server

Two options exist to access [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/):

  1. [Web Instance](#1-jupyter-web-instance)
  2. [Compute Node Instance](#2-jupyter-compute-node-instance)

### 1. Jupyter Web Instance

Users can log into their HPCC accounts via the JupyterHub server instance. To do so, visit the [HPCC JupyterHub server](https://jupyter.hpcc.ucr.edu/). Next provide your HPCC login credentials and click the `Sign In` button.

Account changes can sometimes lead to users needing to restart active cluster sessions, and Jupyter is no different. To restart your Jupyter session, from the "File" tab click "Hub Control Panel". From the new screen click "Stop My Server", then "Start My Server". After a few seconds your session will be restarted.

#### Choosing A Profile

There are a handful of profiles that can be selected from, below is a chart displaying the existing profiles.

| **Profile Name** | **Partition** | **Resources**         | **Time Limit** | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Immediate Server | -             | Shared                | None           | This will run Jupyter on a shared machine with all other users who choose this option. Choose this if you want a server with no time limit at the expense of worse performance. |
| Quick Server     | Short         | 2 cores, 8GB memory   | 2 Hours        | This is for a quick session lasting under 2 hours. Good for testing or debugging work quickly.                                                                                  |
| Compute Intel    | Intel         | 8 cores, 32GB memory  | 24 hours       | This will run on an Intel machine with a 24 hour time limit.                                                                                                                    |
| Compute Batch    | Batch         | 8 cores, 32GB memory  | 24 hours       | This will run on an Batch (AMD) machine with a 24 hour time limit.                                                                                                              |
| Compute Epyc     | Epyc          | 8 cores, 32GB memory  | 24 hours       | This will run on an AMD machine with a 24 hour time limit.                                                                                                                      |
| Highmem          | Highmem       | 8 cores, 128GB memory | 24 hours       | This will run on the highmem partition, good for jobs that require a lot of memory.                                                                                             |

**NOTE** that when your job reaches the specified time limit the job will be terminated and jupyter session closed. Jupyter autosaves every 2 minutes, but any new work will be lost and any running jobs cancelled once the time limit is reached.

If your job requires more flexible resources, please refer to the below section for running Jupyter directly on a compute node.

-->

### 2. Jupyter Compute Node Instance

#### a. Steps

First, start an interactive session on a compute node

```
srun -p epyc -t 4:00:00 -c 4 --mem=10GB --pty bash -l    # Customize as needed
```

After your job has been scheduled, activate the jupyterlab module and start the server.

```
module load jupyterlab/
start-jupyter.sh
```

A fed seconds after running `start-jupyter.sh` it will prompt you for a password. Enter a password that you would like to use to access the notebook.
NOTE: Text will not show up when you type your password, this is expected.

![jupyter start](/img/jupyter1.png)

After entering a password, it will print some text guiding you on creating a tunnel.

![jupyter info](/img/jupyter2.png)

**NOTE: The port and node will likely be different than pictured. This is expected, and unique to each session.**

As the text suggests, enter the `ssh -NL` command in your terminal or setup MobaXTerm with the supplied details. If using the `ssh` method, the **terminal is expected to hang after logging in and no further output should be generated.**

After a few seconds the server will start. At this point you can navigate to "http://127.0.0.1:PORT/lab" on your local machine, **replacing PORT with the port assigned when running the `start-jupyter.sh` command (9345 in the example above).

#### b. Logging In

After navigating to the login page, you will be prompted for the password you originally gave the notebook.

After logging in, you can use the notebook as you would on our hosted JupyterLab server.

#### c. Shutting Down

When you are finished with your session, you can stop the Jupyter server from running by going to "File > Shut Down" in the notebook, or by entering Ctrl+C in the terminal window.
