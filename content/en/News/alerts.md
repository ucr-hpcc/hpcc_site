## Unannounced exceptions

__21-Jun-2024: Network Outage__

Starting 5:15 PM the network connection to the HPCC server room is down. This might be related to a larger network problem on campus, see [here](https://techalerts.ucr.edu/). Update 7:30 PM: the netword connection is working again, but as it turns out there also is a problem with one of the HVAC units in the server room. At this point, it is unclear how the two problems are connected. Currently, facilities has the situation under control. To avoid overheating, the Slurm queue has been paused by the sys admins. Current jobs will continue to run, while pending jobs will need to wait until the situation improves. 


## Past exceptions

__CANCELLED: June 14th Shutdown Ahead of Genomics Electrical Maintenance__

Starting on Friday, June 14th at 8am and extending to Saturday, June 15th at 11pm UCR HPCC will be powering down the cluster ahead of a scheduled electrical shutdown of the UCR Genomics Building. To make the most of this downtime, HPCC will offline the cluster on the 14th in order to install routine software updates and perform other minor maintenance tasks. During the shutdown, most of our online services hosted from the UCR Genomics Building will be unavailable including, but is not limited to: SSH, Slurm, Rstudio, JupyterHub, OnDemand, and web file access. Please save your work on any of these services before the maintenance window. E-mail support may be temporarily interrupted, but should otherwise remain online. We recommend checking our [Slack channel](https://ucr-hpcc.slack.com/) for any minor status updates during the shutdown.

If you submit a Slurm or OnDemand job that extends into the maintenance window, you will receive an error containing "ReqNodeNotAvail". Your job will queue, but will not start, until maintenance is over. If you want your job to start sooner, cancel the job request, and resubmit your job with a shorter --time duration, such that your job will finish before the maintenance window begins.

We apologize for the disruption to your research and teaching workflows. Thanks for your understanding.

__7-May-2024: AC Unit Repairs, Slurm Paused__

After investigating a High Temperature warning on one of our AC units, campus Facilities determined a component in one of the AC units appears to be faulty and needs to be replaced. They are planning on receiving the replacement part the morning of the 8th, but in order to do the replacement both AC units will need to be taken offline. We've began putting nodes into a "draining" state in an attempt to bring the load on the cluster as low as possible to best manage heat in the server room. Existing jobs will continue to run, but newly scheduled jobs will be put in the queue until we can confirm that the repair has been completed and the AC units are online again. We know this is disruptive to your research and teaching, and we apologize for this development.

**Update 1:** Facilities was unable to complete the job in their time allotted for today, and will continue work tomorrow the morning (May 9th).

**Update 2:** While performing the repair, facilities identified a leak which needs to be patched before refilling the refrigerant, otherwise any refrigerant would immediately escape. The ETA for this repair, as given to us by facilities, is May 10th.

**Update 3:** Facilities has contacted us to say that they are finishing up the repairs and that we can begin to start loading the servers again. As such we've released ~50% of the nodes to begin running jobs again.

**Update 4:** Facilities has completed the repairs, and all nodes have been released.

__08-Mar-2024 AC Unit Refrigerant Leak, Queue Paused__

The UCR HPCC Slurm queue has been paused due to another AC malfunction in the server room. Earlier on Thursday (March 7th) afternoon, UCR Facilities was called in to check an AC alarm and determined that one of our AC units had low refrigerant. While attempting to recharge the AC refrigerant a leak occurred, forcing personnel to evacuate the room for their own safety. They intend to start the repair first thing on Friday (March 8th) morning. But because that AC unit is still not running at full capacity, cooling is limited. As such, the Slurm queue has been paused as a precaution to keep the room within a safe temperature. We understand that this will be disruptive to your work, and we apologize for this development.

Update 1: After speaking with the person performing the repair, they said that the repair could take all day. We will make further announcements as we receive updates.

Update 2: The repair has been completed and the Slurm queue has been released.

__22-Feb-2023: Upgrades of OS and GPFS__

Starting Thursday, February 22nd at 8:00am and lasting until Friday, February 23rd at 8:00pm, the cluster will be unavailable due 
to an upgrade of the Operating System as well as our central storage system. Any submitted jobs that overlap with the shutdown time will
be queued with the reason "ReqNodeNotAvail" and will need to be requeued with a shorter time or wait until the maintenance is over
at which point they will automatically start.

During the shutdown services will be unavailable including, but not limited to: SSH, RStudio, JupyterHub, OnDemand, and web-based file access.
If you need additional information or help, you can reach us at our [Slack](https://ucr-hpcc.slack.com/) or outside of the shutdown through
email (support@hpcc.ucr.edu).

**Update**: The shutdown had finished and the Slurm queue has been reopened.

__19-Jan-2024: AC Unit Repair Followup__

Due to followup maintenance required following the January 17th repairs, the
slurm queue will once again need to be haulted in order to manage heat output
in the server room. Maintenance should only take a few hours, after which the
queue will be released again.

**Update**: The repair has been completed. Nodes will be resumed and queue opened.

__17-Jan-2024: AC Unit repair__

The AC units in the HPCC server room are experiencing issues. To keep the
operating temperature within safe limits, the job queue has been halted. New
and pending jobs will stay queued, while currently running jobs will be allowed
to finish. We apologize for the inconvenience.

**Update**: The maintenance has completed, but a followup repair will be required in
order to return to 100% operation of the AC units.

__14 Aug, 2023: Login and GPFS storage issues__

* The login service on the primary headnode failed on Monday afternoon. A new headnode with updated software is now
  online, so users may access their files and do some light work. The GPFS cluster file system also exhibited some
  performance stalls. The Slurm scheduler has been paused until this issue subsides.

__4-Aug-2023: Upgrades of OS, GPFS, Slurm, Head Nodes and Power Distribution__

* HPCC staff will be performing maintenance work on Aug 4th to Aug 5th that will require a shut down of the HPCC cluster. 
  Objectives for this event include the following upgrades: GPFS, Slurm, OS upgrade to Rocky Linux 8.8, 
  electrical reconfiguration of PDUs, and various other maintenance tasks.

* Update Aug 6th: Due to underestimated workload on planned maintenance tasks, services are still offline.
  Basic functionality should be restored by the end of the day.

* Update Aug 7th: Maintenance is still ongoing. Currently, we are redeploying computer nodes and other services. 
  User login is restricted until the central data storage system has been re-mounted.

* Update Aug 8th: SSH login has been restored. Users can access their data and perform light work on the head nodes
  until access to a larger number of compute nodes has been restored. In addition, web-based file sharing and JupyterHub are available again.
  RStudio Server will be restored next. 

- Update Aug 9th: Slurm has been redployed and is operational. A larger number of computer nodes have been redeployed and are available 
  to users again.

- Final update Aug 11th: All remaining services are available again. The maintenance is complete. This includes remaining CPU and GPU nodes, etc. 
  We apologize for the extended time it took us to bring all services online again. Thank you for your understanding.

__17-18 Jul, 2023: Slurm halted__

* Facilities had to perform maintenance on the AC units due to the formation of condensation water by the AC units,
  possibly caused by hot summer days. During the maintenance Slurm jobs had to be halted to avoid overheating.
  Running jobs will be allowed to continue, provided that the server room does not get too hot.
